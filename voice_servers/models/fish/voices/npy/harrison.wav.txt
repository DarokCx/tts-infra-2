 I gave my first speech in May 2010. It was at my public hometown library and half a dozen people came out. I just kind of stood there and rambled. There were a lot of awkward silences, one guy clapped. Since then I've given over 500 keynote speeches. I'm still getting better, I have a long way to go. One thing I've always done is collect speech transcripts and bits of poetry. I studied them, inhaled them to see greatness in action.
