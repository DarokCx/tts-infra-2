 Actors in theatre, as sometimes filmed in television, may be asked to deliver monologues in auditions. Audition monologues demonstrate an actor's ability to prepare a piece and deliver a performance. These pieces are usually limited to two minutes or less and are often paired with contrasting monologues, common and traumatic, classical, contemporary. The choice of monologues for an audition often depends on the play or role.
